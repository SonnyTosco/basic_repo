Creating a repository:

mkdir new_project
cd new_project
git init <<initializes the new repository you created 'new_project'

---
Changing the state of the repository to staged:

git add index.html <<index.html is the file within new_project that you are staging for upload

git add . <<adds all changed files in the repository to the staging area

---
Take a snapshot of all the staged files:

git commit -m "index.html added" <<the quotations is where you can add context to what you updated. From here index.html is considered committed

---
To see the list of commits:

git log <<give you a list of all your commits and the messages you put in

---
See the state our files are in:

git status <<when you change a file, it's status moves to modified again

---
Creating a new branch:

git branch new_feature master <<command to run to create a branch called new_feature from our master branch

git checkout new_feature <<makes the new branch the current branch

-or- git checkout -b new_feature <<the hi-speed way of creating a new branch and making it your current branch. Same as above, but in one step

---
Seeing all existing branches:

git branch

---
Switching to a new branch:

git checkout <branch name>

---
Merging branches:

git checkout master <<switches you to the master branch from the repository you were working on

git merge new_feature <<takes the name of the branch you want to merge (new_feature) into your current branch.
