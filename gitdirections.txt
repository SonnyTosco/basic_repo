Steps I took to push to GitHub

- Created a new repository on Github 'basic_repo'
- created a local repository on GitHub as well 'basic_repo'
- added 4 html files to local 'basic_repo'
- linked the files together using the commands below
  git remote add origin https://github.com/<github username>/<github repo name>.git
  git push origin master
- verify they made it to repository
- drag another file into local 'basic_repo'
- git add, git commit, git push
